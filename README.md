# Live Webex user presence React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It pulls all users from an org and lists their webex presence status. user status is updated in real time as it changes on webex.

## Run the App
To run the app you need to run `npm install` from terminal to install node modules and once that's completed you can run `npm start`.

### ...Work In progress...
App isn't fully functional yet.
